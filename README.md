Project Overview
Objective: Build a predictive model to classify clients likely to churn.
Context: The bank experienced a 15% drop in active clients during the last quarter.
Deliverables: Provide actionable insights for retention and a scalable machine learning solution.
Dataset
Size: 10,127 records, 21 features.
Variables:
Target: attrition_flag (Existing Customer or Attrited Customer).
Features: Demographic, financial, and activity-based variables, including:
customer_age, credit_limit, total_trans_amt, months_on_book, etc.
Source: Proprietary financial institution data.
Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM framework:

Business Understanding: Define objectives and success criteria.
Data Understanding: Explore and preprocess the dataset.
Modeling: Train multiple models (e.g., Neural Networks, SVM, Random Forest).
Evaluation: Compare metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and AUC.
Deployment: Provide model recommendations and implementation strategies.
Models Used
Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Hidden layers: 1 with 25 neurons (ReLU activation).
Output layer: Sigmoid activation.
Optimizer: Adam.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Kernel: RBF.
Random Forest:
Trees: 100.
Results
ANN:
Accuracy: 92.20%
AUC: 0.94
SVM:
Accuracy: 92.49%
AUC: 0.95
Insights:
High sensitivity and precision demonstrate the models' effectiveness in identifying at-risk clients.
